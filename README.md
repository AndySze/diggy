# Diggy

Diggy is a DHTML Game Engine (DGE). If you tried to pronounce "DGE", you'd probably say it like "Diggy". That explains the name.

Diggy is _not_:

* a DOM selector
* an event manager
* a canvas or SVG library
* useful for standard web apps
* meant to do anything but make DOM games

Note: Diggy has been abandoned by its original author. Still, it's pretty full-featured; see the [example game called Bombada](http://playbombada.appspot.com/).

## Known issues

* Pretty sure `localStorage` doesn't work right.
* Weird pseudo-Titanium support?
* Breaks in IE (but fuck that browser anyway).
* The whole inheritance pattern is really odd and kinda junky.
* Just `grep` for "todo", holy crap.
