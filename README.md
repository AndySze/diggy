# Diggy

## About

Diggy is a DHTML Game Engine (DGE).
If you tried to pronounce "DGE", you'd probably say it like "Diggy".
That explains the name.

Diggy is not:
	* useful for standard web apps
	* a DOM selector
	* an event manager
	* a canvas or SVG library
	* meant to do anything but make games DOM games

I am abandoning Diggy because it turns out I'd rather be making games using canvas.
