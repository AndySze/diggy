# Diggy

Diggy is a DHTML Game Engine (DGE).
If you tried to pronounce "DGE", you'd probably say it like "Diggy".
That explains the name.

Diggy is _not_:
	* a DOM selector
	* an event manager
	* a canvas or SVG library
	* useful for standard web apps
	* meant to do anything but make DOM games

_Note: I am abandoning Diggy because it turns out I'd rather be making games using canvas. Go figure._

## Known issues

- Pretty sure `localStorage` doesn't work right.
- Weird pseudo-Titanium support?
- Breaks in IE (but fuck that browser anyway).
- The whole inheritance pattern is really odd and kinda junky.
- Just `grep` for "todo", holy crap.
