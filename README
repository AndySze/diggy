DESCRIPTION

What DGE is:
	- DHTML game engine

What DGE is not:
	- useful for standard webapps
	- DOM selector
	- event manager
	- application framework

TODO:

- replace el.style calls to use DGE.css() instead (might not be a good idea, for performance's sake)
- need global methods for out() and over() for the whole screen
- need global methods for the keyboard
- take out constants like SPRITE_WIDTH and put them where they belong, on DGE.Sprite
  - additionally, will need a .conf to work for anything like that to set the defaults elegantly ... right?
